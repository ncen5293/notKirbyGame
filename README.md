# notKirbyGame
Made in Unity2D using assets from Kirby games.

A short 5 - 10 minute game I made.

You crashlanded onto some planet and am unable to fly out, then accidents happen.

--------------------------------------------------------
How to Play
--------------------------------------------------------
Left and Right Arrow Keys to Move (no numpad)

Up Arrow to Jump

Left Control to Attack/Parry Projectiles

Left Alt to Shoot Projectiles

Space to Boost Jump if player has energy

X to drop sword if equipped (not told in game)

Move to a ledge to climb it if close enough to the top

--------------------------------------------------------
Balance?
--------------------------------------------------------
Parrying projectiles might be too hard with a sword but I made it much easier with default taser.

Watch out for enemy projectiles being destroyed (they might still hurt)

After boosting, the player won't be able to attack for a second after landing sometimes.

You appear to be hovering, don't assume you can fly.

Only Kirby music, no other sound effects.

I should probably put a credits button on the main menu to show which Kirby games I used so players don't have to go through the entire 5-10minutes.

Don't attack throwables on the ground or they might break.

Collectible swords will lose durability if hit with a projectile

Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------
Player plays climb animation when there is no wall in front of the lower half of the body while there is a wall in front of the upper half of the body.
Don't need to fix because it is only a problem in 1 part of the game.

When paused, the player can keep tapping 'up' or jump then unpause to be launched into the air. 
Fixable by just checking when game is paused but I enjoy this happening.

When the player drops a sword while facing a wall, they might play a climb animation.
Fixable by just checking if there is a sword rather than checking if its not ground but I kinda like see this happen.
Plus the player isn't told how to drop their weapon unless they read through this readme.
Then again X is close to left alt and space.

Sometimes the player doesn't want to take an item even though they touch it.
